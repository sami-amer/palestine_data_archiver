He and his wife, Selenid Gonzalez-Frey, rented a two-bedroom apartment in Murray Hill, delighted to be in a city with so much to offer.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Seven years later, as Dr. Frey neared the end of his training, a decision loomed: Was he going to remain in town and establish a practice, or settle elsewhere? “We really thought we were going to stay,” he said.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">But it was complicated. New York City was alluring, but by then the couple had two children, and they couldn’t deny the appeal of raising them in a place where wide-open spaces were just outside the front or back door.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Covid crystallized things. “The activities our kids were doing got closed, and we felt pretty claustrophobic,” said Dr. Frey, 34. “We thought that if we went somewhere else we’d be able to afford not just more room but a much nicer place.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class=""></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">In July of 2020, the family moved to Buffalo, where Dr. Frey grew up and where Ms. Gonzalez-Frey, 34, is now an assistant professor of education at the State University of New York. Home is a four-bedroom colonial on a one-acre lot.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">The Freys were among the more than 837,400 people who submitted change-of-address requests from New York City addresses in 2020, a 36 percent increase over 2019, according to a pandemic migration report from the NYC office of the comptroller, citing United States Postal Service data.

They never planned to be gone forever. Can’t quit you, baby, and all that. But some who left during the pandemic have made the move permanent — and they’re dealing with the fallout.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Take the Freys. They’re very happy with the move, but their New York City friends aren’t so happy with them. Covid is a passing thing, they told the couple, but New York is forever. They would regret what they were doing, the doomsayers warned, noting the folly of making a consequential decision based on a temporary situation.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class=""></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“There was a real sense that they felt betrayed,” said Dr. Frey, who is now on the staff of Erie County Medical Center, and who recently started <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://prudentplasticsurgeon.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Prudent Plastic Surgeon</a>, an investment advice website aimed at his fellow doctors. “We got a lot of, ‘How can you leave? New York is struggling, and you need to be supportive.’ And it was made clear to me that I wasn’t doing that. Our way of handling it was to emphasize to our friends that we loved New York City and that we weren’t abandoning it in a time of need. But we still felt judged.”</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Of course, moving is always a big deal, and not just for the people who are boxing up their possessions. The ground also trembles under the feet of the friends who remain behind, and who could be forgiven for feeling that U-Haul is breaking up the old gang.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">But when the city that’s being left is New York, the level of attendant annoyance seems especially high; it feels like a personal insult to friends of the soon-to-be ex-resident. Now factor in the pandemic, and distress starts moving into the red zone — indignation.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“The people who moved out of New York during Covid made the decision that the city wasn’t safe enough, wasn’t appealing enough, wasn’t good enough, was too expensive,” said Gail Saltz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “And their friends may see that as an indictment of their own choice, especially if they’re ambivalent about their choice. A defense might be, ‘I’m a loyal person and I’m being loyal to my city, and you all are abandoning it.’”</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">The abandonment charge was especially painful for Joel Schnell, 72, a lifelong New Yorker — that is, until last year, when he lost his income and also became increasingly concerned about his 97-year-old mother living alone in Florida.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“So: pandemic, no income, my mother … We thought it was time to go to the beach and hide,” said Mr. Schnell, who works in women’s fashion. “The truth is we were scared being in New York.”</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">The pandemic was raging in November of 2020 — and so, as a matter of fact, were some of Mr. Schnell’s friends — when he and his wife, Lynne White, a former news anchor, sold their co-op on the Lower East Side and lit out for a two-bedroom rental in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class=""></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“Our friends were like, ‘We’re not out from under this, and New Yorkers should stick together.

Even his dry cleaner gave him grief.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">True, some who left might still be in New York if not for the pandemic. Others were already thinking it was time to move on and move away, and Covid was the event that pushed them over the edge. Perhaps they wanted more space. Perhaps they wanted a lower cost of living. Now they were able to work remotely, so why not live somewhere else?</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">But whatever their reasons for leaving, they left some irate friends.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“Covid was the last straw for some people in my neighborhood,” said Lazarus Jackson, 39, a truck driver who lives in a rental in the Bronx. 
“They were like, ‘I don’t want to be here anymore,’ and they sold their house and left. I’m not happy with these people at all. It’s breaking a bond. We’ve been friends for 20, 25 years.”</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">For him, the distress goes beyond the personal. He sees his neighborhood in jeopardy. “I tell my friends, ‘There was a lot that went into you having that house in the first place. It’s been in your family since the ’60s. A lot of sacrifices were made for you to have it. Why sell it?’” he said.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“When people leave the community — this isn’t a gentrified area — it’s not like things get better,” Mr. Jackson continued. “So when my friends say, ‘I just want to get out of the city,’ I just think it’s a pretty short-term way of looking at things.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class=""></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Until the pandemic hit, Grace MacDougall had no plans to leave Manhattan, where she and her best friend from high school shared a two-bedroom rental in a walk-up building in Five Points. But once she realized that she liked working remotely, and saw how much she could save on rent, well, cue the moving van.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“But my roommate was so upset. She hated the fact that I left and hated the fact that I left during Covid,” said Ms. MacDougall, 27, the marketing and growth manager for a start-up, who tested positive for the virus during the first week of the pandemic. “She had convinced me to move to New York in the first place. She had shown me the ropes, the ins and outs. She felt that I was breaking up with her, but also that I was breaking up with the greatest city in the world.

But why couldn’t they understand his situation?</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">“How did they expect me to keep paying the rent when I didn’t have any money?” asked Mr. Clark, 35. “I’m upset that they didn’t get my dilemma.”</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Three months after Ms. Stockton-Brown moved to Philadelphia, her censorious friend sheepishly called to say she and her partner had just moved to Portland, Maine.
