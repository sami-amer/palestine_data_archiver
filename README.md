# Palestine Article Saver

Place holder Readme

The goal of this script is to be able to grab articles that mention Palestine from the NYT and save them locally. This allows people to run this on their machine or in a server and create their own NYT archive, due to the NYT's archive being inaccessible in full article text.

The script works in two parts: First, it uses various NYT API's to get the article's URL.  Then it uses some web scraper to get the article data itself.
